<h1>Welcome to My Allocine</h1>

<p>This is a project that requires to work with a movie-related database using SQL (Structured Query Language). </p>

<Each>The database has multiple tables: actors, genres, directors, movies, movies_genres, directors_movies, reviews, movies_ratings_reviews, and movies_actors. Each table has specific columns with unique IDs and descriptions (e.g. act_fname and act_lname for the actors table, and mov_title and mov_year for the movies table). Y

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>The task is to write SQL requests to perform various operations on the data 
within the tables, and the results will be saved in a file named "my_allocine.rb".</p>

<p>It will start with writing requests to display all actors and genres,and then go on to more complex requests such as finding the year when a specific movie was released.</p>

<h2>Solution Description</h2>
<p>The problem of retrieving movie-related information from a database was solved using SQL (Structured Query Language). </p>
<p>SQL is a standardized programming language used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. </p>

<p>The solution involves writing SQL statements in the form of commands to retrieve information from the database tables (actors, genres, directors, movies, etc.). </p>

<p>The SQL statements used in this project include SELECT, ADD, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, and TRUNCATE. </p>

<p>The SQL requests are written in a file named "my_allocine.rb" and are executed against the database to retrieve the desired information.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install and run this program, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the database using the command: wget https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-claris/movies.db</li>
<li>Connect to the database using the command: sqlite3 movies.db</li>
<li>Write SQL requests for the objectives outlined in the program. </li>
<li>These requests should be written in a file named my_allocine.rb and should be formatted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To run the file "my_allocine.rb" in the command line, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the terminal or command prompt</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory where the file is located using the "cd" command</li>
<li>Type "ruby my_allocine.rb" and press enter.</li>
<li>This will execute the file and run the SQL requests that are stored inside it.  </li>
</ul>
